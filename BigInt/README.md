# BigInt

BigInt values represent numeric values which are too large to be represented by the number primitive.

# Description
A BigInt value, also sometimes just called a BigInt, is a bigint primitive, created by appending n to the end of an integer literal, or by calling the BigInt() function (without the new operator) and giving it an integer value or string value.

# MAX_SAFE_INTERGER
The value of the largest integer n such that n and n + 1 are both exactly representable as a Number value. The value of Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is 9007199254740991 2^53 − 1.

# MIN_SAFE_INTERGER
The value of the smallest integer n such that n and n − 1 are both exactly representable as a Number value. The value of Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER is −9007199254740991 (−(2^53 − 1))
